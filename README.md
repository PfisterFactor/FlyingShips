# FlyingShips
This mod is mainly a learning experience for me with Forge and (very non-functional like) Scala, so I apologize for any spaghetti code or redundent statements.

# Build
This mod is currently in a very pre-WIP stage (like barely even functional yet), so no builds and/or instructions will be posted until a proof of concept can be achieved by me.

# Credits
Heavy inspiration (and lots of code basis) for this mod comes from <b>Cuchaz</b> and his incredible [Ships mod](https://www.cuchazinteractive.com/ships/) along with <b>MMM_MasterM</b> for his [MetaWorlds](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1291311-metaworlds-mod-v0-995-fly-working-worlds-around) mod and <b>thebest108_</b> with his [Valkyrian Warfare Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTWAMOpxVVY&feature=youtu.be)
