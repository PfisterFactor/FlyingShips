# FlyingShips
This mod is mainly a learning experience for me with Forge and (very non-functional like) Scala, so I apologize for any spaghetti code.

# Build
This mod is currently in a very pre-WIP stage (like barely even functional yet), so no builds and/or instructions will be posted until a proof of concept can be achieved.
